I solve problems mainly to improve my Python skills, but I also try to solve them in the most efficient way possible. 

Speed is not the only thing that matters, but I try to keep it in mind.

Data structures and algorithms are the main focus of this repository, but I also solve some problems from other domains.

## ðŸ“š How to use this repository 

Each problem is in a separate folder, and each folder contains a markdown file with the problem link and a python file with the solution.
